Below is what I was able to accomplish:
    - Basic CRUD operations for expertise, users, and posts. 
    - Fetching of single and multiple post with filtering of multiple post.
    - Use in-memory database for operations and preload with some data (LoadDatabase.java)
    - Test cases to cover all the services.

If I had more time to work on this, outside the additional topics, I would have like 
to implement Spring HATEOAS in the project. I would have also like to have done integration 
testing. Lastly, I would like to give better response for the CRUD operations.
