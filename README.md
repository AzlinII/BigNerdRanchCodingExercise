# Backend Exercise

**Please limit your time working on this exercise to four hours.**

Please create an application implementing a CRUD web service for `posts`. 

- The API should support `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` of the `posts` resource with validation.
- Support fetching multiple posts, a single post, and filtering posts by user.
- Use an in-memory database or native data structures of your choice for managing data. 
- Cover all the important behavior of the code with automated tests. Feel free to choose between integration tests and unit tests.

#### Additional topics

If you have extra time, we'd love to see what you create around any of the topics below:

- Authentication (Basic, OAuth2, JWT)
- Utilize a database for persistent storage (Feel free to choose an engine of your choice)
- Deploy the application to a cloud computing platform (Heroku, GCP, AWS, Azure, etc.)
